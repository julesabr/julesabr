## About Me :computer:
I started programming when I was in high school - about 8+ years ago. By day, I am a Software Developer who works primarily on web applications. My go to 
technologies of choice for this is .NET (C#) and Angular. By night, I work on my own projects which is usually a game project made with Unity. Video games 
are my passion. It was thanks to them that I was introduced to C# as a language and programming in general. Currently, I am working on several game projects
on my free time, while trying to absorb as much new information about game development as I can.  

I am also very "best practices" oriented. I do believe in following the best practices for whatever language I am coding in to ensure the it can be easily 
changed and scaled in the future, even if it requires some extra effort now. I tend to take an agile approach with all of my projects. I am also a big
believer in writing automation tests and Test Driven Development. I am also a big fan of Domain Driven Design and Microservice architecture, despite
those terms being reduced to mere buzzwords. I know many developers tend to be critical with those concepts. However, I enjoy seeing them applied in complex
projects where it makes sense. Despite what anyone might say, DDD and Microservices don't work on every kind of project and I am not a fan of trying to 
peg a square into a triangle-shaped hole.

### Other Languages :speech_balloon:
Besides C#, I am also comfortable in Java, C++, and Python (although some syntax refreshers might be needed for this one.)

### Other Interests :video_game:
As I have mentioned earlier, I am a big gamer. I have been playing video games almost all my life. Practically grew up with titles like Halo, Mass Effect,
and many others. Fun fact: I still have a Gamecube as well as a disc collection of all of my older games, including the Gamecube ones. Other than games, I 
also like anime, movies, and listening to metal or dark techno music. I also like to ride motorcyles as well. I love to go for a ride, cruising in the 
summertime.

### More :bulb:
If you wish to reach out, my contact details are here on my Github. Unfortunately, I don't have much more at the moment. Eventually, I plan to add a 
website here where I will post my game projects. When my schedule clears up some more, I may also start taking some web development side jobs in the future.
If that happens I will update my profile here.
